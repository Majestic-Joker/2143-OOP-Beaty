## P02 - MyVector Class 2
### Joshua Beaty
### Description:
Using code from [Program 1](../P01) create a more robust MyVector class that includes
some added functionality with the overloading of some C++ operators. The operations
performed by using a particular operator will be defined by us with a brief discussion 
to do anything we want.
